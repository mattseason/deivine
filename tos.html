                <p><strong>1 Information about us</strong></p>
                <p>1.1 We operate the website www.deivine.com. We are Deivine Limited, a limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 09108773 and with our main trading office at 39 Waveney Way Northampton NN5 7JX</p>
                <p>1.2 We are regulated by UK trading Standards.</p>
                <p><strong>2 Your status</strong></p>
                <p>2.1 The Products on our website can only be purchased if you are at least 18 years old. We are not allowed by law to supply these Products to you if you do not satisfy these age requirements. For this reason, we may refuse an order or refuse to make a delivery at our discretion. If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to order Products through our site.</p>
                <p>2.2 By placing an order through this website, you confirm that you and the person the order is to be delivered to, are at least 18 years old. You also confirm that you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts.</p>
                <p>2.3 By ordering Products from this website, you consent to us carrying out an independent verification to check your age at our discretion should we deem this necessary.</p>
                <p>2.4 If you falsely declare your age to us, you shall be held responsible for all costs, expenses, losses, damage, fines and other penalties that we may suffer or incur as a consequence of your false statement.</p>
                <p><strong>3 How the contract is formed between you and us</strong></p>
                <p>3.1 After placing an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Product has been dispatched (Dispatch Confirmation). The contract between us (Contract) will only be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
                <p>3.2 The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
                <p><strong>4 Our status</strong></p>
                <p>4.1 We may provide links on our site to the websites of other companies, whether affiliated with us or not. We cannot give any undertaking that products you purchase from third party sellers through our site, or from companies to whose website we have provided a link on our site, will be of satisfactory quality, and any such warranties are DISCLAIMED by us absolutely. We will notify you when a third party is involved in a transaction, and we may disclose your personal information related to that transaction to the third party seller.</p>
                <p>4.2 If you are contracting as a consumer, this DISCLAIMER does not affect your statutory rights against us. If you would like information about your legal rights you should contact your local trading standards or citizens advice bureaux.</p>
                <p><strong>5 Consumer cancellation rights</strong></p>
                <p>5.1 If you are contracting as a consumer, you may cancel a Contract at any time within fourteen working days following your receipt of the Products. In this case, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Products in accordance with our refunds policy (set out in clause 9 below).</p>
                <p>5.2 To cancel a Contract, you must inform us by email contact@deivine.com. You must also return the Products to us as soon as reasonably practicable, at your own cost and with the Products unopened and in their original condition. We will not accept the return of any Products which are not unopened and in their original packaging. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right of action against you for compensation.</p>
                <p>5.3 Details of your statutory right of cancellation, and an explanation of how to exercise it, are provided in the Dispatch Confirmation. This provision does not affect your other statutory rights as a consumer.</p>
                <p>5.4 This clause 5 only applies if you are contracting as a consumer.</p>
                <p><strong>6 Availability and delivery</strong></p>
                <p>6.1 Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Dispatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within a reasonable time of the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
                <p><strong>7 Risk and title</strong></p>
                <p>7.1 The Products will be your responsibility from the time of delivery.</p>
                <p>7.2 Ownership of the Products will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Products, including delivery charges.</p>
                <p>7.3 Upon taking ownership of the Products, you agree that you will not disassemble, deconstruct, reverse engineer or create derivative goods based on the whole, or any part, of the Products, nor make any attempt whatsoever to do any such or similar things.</p>
                <p><strong>8 Price and payment</strong></p>
                <p>8.1 The price of the Products and our delivery charges will be as quoted on our site from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.</p>
                <p>8.2 Product prices include VAT. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.</p>
                <p>8.3 Product prices and delivery charges are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
                <p>8.4 Our site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product’s correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you that we are rejecting it.</p>
                <p>8.5 If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably recognised by you as an error, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</p>
                <p>8.6 Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card or PayPal. We accept payment with Master Card, Visa, Electron, Switch, Euro Card, Delta and Electron.</p>
                <p><strong>9 Our refunds policy</strong></p>
                <p>9.1 If you return a Product to us:</p>
                <p>9.1.1 if you are contracting as a consumer, because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the fourteen-day cooling-off period (see clause 5.1 above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day on which you gave us notice of cancellation through our online form. In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full, and any applicable delivery charges. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item to us and all returned Products must be unopened and in their original condition and packaging; or</p>
                <p>9.1.2 for any other reason (for instance, because you have notified us in accordance with clause 23 that you do not agree to a change in these terms and conditions or in any of our policies, or because you consider that the Product is defective), we will examine the returned Product and will notify you of your refund via e-mail within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund. We will refund the price of a defective Product in full, any applicable delivery charges and any reasonable costs you incur in returning the item to us.</p>
                <p>9.2 We will refund any money received from you, normally by using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>10 Warranty</strong></p>
                <p>10.1 We warrant to you that any Product purchased from us through our site will, on delivery, conform in all material respects with its description, be of satisfactory quality, and be reasonably fit for all the purposes for which products of that kind are commonly supplied.</p>
                <p>10.2 Subject to clause 10.1, we will not be liable for the warranty set out in 10.1 if you alter, change, dilute, concentrate, mix, modify and/or repackage any Product purchased through us in any way whatsoever.</p>
